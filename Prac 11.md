<h1>Prac 11 Final Learning Journal</h1>
<h2>Learning Activities</h2>
<p>This week was the culmination of all the previous weeks work spent towards the group project. We finished the project, with final touch-ups and polish where needed.
</p>

<h2>Resources and Links</h2>
<p>No links were accessed. This week consisted purely of hard work bringing everything we know and had completed together for presentation and final submission. Of course this does include polishing and final adjustments.</p>

<h2>Estimated Hours</h2>
<p>This week i personally contributed ~42hrs. The brunt of which was done across Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. With a few hours spent earlier in the week for the group meeting and Stand-up.

<h2>Content Insights</h2>
<p>Reflecting on not just this week, but the project as a whole, this was an outstanding opportunity. An opportunity where i could not just learn, but put what i had learnt to practise developing a dynamic website, developing a theme, and critically of course, working with and according to, a team inside of a collaborative development workflow.<br>

In terms of WordPress site-creation, it was very interesting learning about different ways i could display and order content. Even with something as simple as a Separator block. Separators in effect serve as a page break, and as i found it was very effective visually speaking to show content in an ordered, structured way. Of course there are many more tricks i learnt, such as distributing text or images with columns, or utilising post categories, to categorise different posts and display them as such either on pages or on their own.<br>

As for working on the theme, i found Gulp and its 'buildStyles' and 'watch' features to be instrumental in efficiently viewing any changes I’d make on a web browser. Viewing a version of the site with any and all changes immediately applied, made it infinitely easier to develop/polish our Heartland Hits theme.</p>

<h2>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h2>
<p>The Content Insights somewhat delved into this section, but simply put I’ve not just cemented previous knowledge, but learnt a plethora of new skills. The single most important part i picked up, towards my future career and employability, has to be learning to follow a team-orientated and structured development workflow. Complete with version control and regular project updates. All this was done through industry-standard software/platforms such as Trello and GitHub. I believe that experience and now having this baseline knowledge and understanding, is going to be crucial for me in future jobs. Now mind you I have worked in a similar capacity before, but to this extent, and to this level of industry-grade protocol, I had not. I had little experience before, so overall this was certainly a worthwhile experience.</p>
