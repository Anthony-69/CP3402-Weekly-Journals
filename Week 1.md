<h2>Estimated Hours</h2>
For this pracical i spent the first 2 practical sessions (2hrs each) working on it as well as 4hours of my own time at home, totalling 8hrs. Most of that was familiarising myself with different style elements and the inner-workings of website.

<h2>Content Insights</h2>
<p>I learned how to host static websites using Github Pages, as well as using Bootstrap templates. I personally found a lot of problems in trying to edit and change the Bootstrap theme that i used because of how they link their CSS to the templates. It was very frustrating so i ended up deciding on just modifying the elements CSS inside the page itself, which is obviously not how that is normally done without a CSS file but i found myself forced into that. In spite of the difficulties, granted the site isn't perfect, i found that i had created a very nice and functioning static website.</p>

<h2>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h2>
<p>In terms of "self-teaching"/studying i didn't discover anything new about myself or how i've found it's most efficient for me to learn. I do know however, that i still have a lot to learn and i need to revise the LinkedIn learning courses.</p>
<p>Markdown was very useful for me personally as it was a great reference point for my website.</p>
<p>Given the problems i found with using Bootstrap i do not plan on using it much if at all in my professional work and future career.</p>
