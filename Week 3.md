<h1>Week 3</h1>
<h2>Learning Activities</h2>
<p>For this week i experimented using Wordpress as well as forming groups for the group project.</p>

<h2>Resources and Links</h2>
<p>I didn't end up needing to use anything from youtube this week, the main resource was actually the Cairns tutor finding me and the other students a good and free web hosting provider.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.infinityfree.net/">Infinity Free Hosting</p>

<h2>Estimated Hours</h2>
For this pracical i roughly 8hrs. 2 of which was spent in the practical performing the group formation task. The rest was spent studying Wordpress and fiddling around with it.

<h2>Content Insights</h2>
<p>I learnt how to host websites using Infinity Free as well as manage websites through the file manager. On top of that i became decently familiar with Wordpress and it's style of creating websites. Which personally so far is better than Joomlas.</p>

<h2>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h2>
<p>Unfortunately i could not finish this practical on time, i am currently a week behind and need to catch up soon. On another topic, Wordpress is the CMS with the highest share in the market, so continuing to learn it and use it will be very beneficial to my career if i do choose to go down this route. So far the subject while sometimes frustrating with the different "programs" has been quite enjoyable. Even with finishing practicals late at times. This week as mentioned above included a group formation task interviewing other students. Through this i found i was on quite similar grounds in terms of employability. Most everyone used similar communication methods (discord), and people could work around others schedules if needed for team meetings. One thing however that stuck out, is my above-average positive attitude, which in terms of being hired in the future into teams it bodes very well for me</p>
