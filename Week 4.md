<h1>Week 4</h1>
<h2>Learning Activities</h2>
<p>For this week i installed WordPress locally and worked on the assignment, as well as tried to catch up on some late practicals.</p>

<h2>Resources and Links</h2>
<p>Simply put i just searched for WordPress local development and found wpengine.com.</p>
<p><a href="https://wpengine.com.au/local/">Local WordPress hosting</p>

<h2>Estimated Hours</h2>
I put in around 9-11 hours of work, all split up in couple hour increments across the week. I spent the time slowly working at the assignment.

<h2>Content Insights</h2>
<p>I learnt how to professionally host and develop sites locally, as opposed to just making a basic html file in some code editor. I learnt how to do so with WordPress. I also got very familiar with the Astra WordPress theme.</p>

<h2>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h2>
<p>The experience i acquired this week is very much key to my employability and career prospects. Admittedly while basic these skills are very much essential. This of course includes getting familiar with a range of WordPress themes, namely as mentioned above Astra.</p>
