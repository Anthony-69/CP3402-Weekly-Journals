<h1>Week 5</h1>
<h2>Learning Activities</h2>
<p>This weeks practical involved creating a child theme. In this case for the Astra parent theme i had been using for the assignment.</p>

<h2>Resources and Links</h2>
<p>Creating a child theme was very simple. I simply followed the two links below, one a video and one a documented guide:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coLDoM1fQcc">How To Create A Child Theme</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/">Developer Resources - Child Themes</p>

<h2>Estimated Hours</h2>
<p>This practical took my no time at all compared to the previous ones. Because the main website was already made, simply creating a child theme took approximately 1 hour.</p>

<h2>Content Insights</h2>
<p>Apart from learning how to create and apply Child Themes, i also got a bit more understanding in the way of a parent themes stylesheet. This was from when i looked through the Astra themes stylesheet for inspiration as to what i should change, what would be most visible for the purposes of testing a child theme.</p>

<h2>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h2>
<p>Frankly, there wasn't really any new "discoveries" sotospeak in this area from the practical. Simply...child themes were introduced and practised.</p>
