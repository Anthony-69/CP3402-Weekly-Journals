<h1>Week 6</h1>
<h2>Learning Activities</h2>
<p>This week i met with my team online and we began working on our group project. After a stand-up meeting this meant setting up communication tools, project hosting and work environments (including version control), as well as standard workflows and all site integrations.</p>

<h2>Estimated Hours</h2>
<p>I spent 3 hours this week on this practical. Most of which was spent in the team meeting.</p>

<h2>Content Insights</h2>
<p>This meeting was a very good starting point for the project. we were able to break the ice quickly and get into a daily stand-up. The entire thing gave me an excellent look into how things would be conducted going forward and what i should expect. Some notable learning experiences that came from the meeting include; agreeing on our workflow, creating a Team Charter in Trello, agreeing on roles and responsibilities for each member, establishing the GitHub repo and practising committing and merging branches with pull requests.</p>

<h2>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h2>
<p>WordPress and GitHub are market leaders in their respective fields. This project, not just this practical, have given me precisely the right experiences i will need to succeed in the future. Especially when working in teams in larger businesses. As far as learning insights go, i was not used to creating a new "sub-branch" sotospeak with the new file i wanted to upload inside it. Then merging that new branch with the branch i wanted to put the file in, in this case the Development branch. This utilisation of version control and industry-level teamwork was quite interesting to me.</p>
