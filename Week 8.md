<h1>Week 8</h1>
<h2>Learning Activities</h2>
<p>For this week i had to theorise and test a learning experiment that would improve my ability to learn compared to previous weeks. This entire theory (outlined below) revolves around the proven health benefits from exercise, benefits both physical and mental. </p>

<h3>Theory</h3>
<p>I hypothesise that by incorporating physical exercise between short periods of work/study (30min periods), my brain function will be better stimulated and in turn my attention span (focus), understanding, and my overall information retention will all be improved measurably.</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>To test my theory i conducted a comparative study by dividing work sessions into two distinct groups. One group would include the physical exercise, while the other would not. To ensure the accuracy of the results the physical exercise routine would remain consistent throughout each work period.<br>

The routine consisted of 5min high-intensity exercise, performing 3 x 10 push-ups, followed by 2 x 10 bodyweight squats. The intensity of the workout had to be high so as to make the contrast in the study groups as stark as possible.<br>

The work sessions would watching different LinkedIn courses for this subject for 2 x 30mins per group. That is a total of 60mins spent working during each group. At the end of a 30min session i would, in as much detail as i can, write what I’d learnt. Once i had performed this for 2 sessions of 30mins for each group i collated the 4 pages of notes and compared how much i had written, and in how much detail i had written it.</p>

<h3>Results and verdict</h3>
<p>The results showed a small improvement in memory retention and understanding when performing the exercises between work sessions. Specifically, by small i mean the difference is almost negligible. The difference in notes only amounted to an average of 2-3 dot points increased with exercise. Considering the energy the workouts take, and the negligible increase in learning, it could be argued that it is not worth taking this approach to learning. Instead i would be better of by using the time to take a small break.</p>

<h2>Resources and Links</h2>
<p>Only one primary link was accessed. Otherwise this practical consisted entirely of my own knowledge and testing.</p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/topics/content-management-systems-cms">LinkedIn Learning Courses.

<h2>Estimated Hours</h2>
<p>Developing the theory and tests, performing those tests, and then documenting the results took me roughly 4hrs split across 3 days of the week.</p>

<h2>Content Insights</h2>
<p>To be frank this was both a good and a bad experience. To elaborate, it is very important to constantly try and innovate, and perfect the ways/methods you go about certain things, be that work, study, anything. However, in this case with less than desired results, the week was spent and i did not get much out of it in the way of improving my means of learning. Despite putting ~4 hours into it. Failure in trial and error comes with the territory of course, the territory of innovation and improvement. It is simply just unfortunate that it did not pan out quite as I’d have hoped for with the results I’d wanted.<br>

With that said, this practical essentially consisted of me going over hours’ worth of CMS courses. So in that respect i consider this a massive success even without any new improvement or breakthrough on my style of learning.</p>

<h2>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h2>
<p>Being able to reinvent how i do things, improve upon them, and find ways to more efficiently work is a skill. A very valuable skill especially in this industry. Possessing it will be invaluable in any future job and in the larger sense, my career. Practising doing so even with subpar results is more than worth it now and in future attempts.<br>

I have learnt one method doesn't work particularly well for me personally, so in the search of others i can cross this one off.</p>

<h1>Week 8 Group Project Work</h1>
<p>This week's stand-up can be viewed in <a href="https://youtu.be/kWc3kiOssig?t=107">this attached link</a>. As last week all team members were present.</p>

<p>As discussed in the stand-up video, following from the previous week, the main update includes adding to the Site.md file, specifically the section for Plugins (More experience from the coming weeks will be needed to be able to detail specifically their processes and usages).</p>

<p>This week i didn't make any changes to the <a href="https://trello.com/b/KYotjzhS/workflow">Trello board</a> as everything I’d been working on either didn't require a change or was still being worked on.</p>

<p>Soon in the coming weeks I will be working on adding content to my local site instance and configuring it to display properly (how and where it's meant to be displayed).</p>
